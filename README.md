<p align="justify">Overall, the Yale School of Art website appears to be unstructured and difficult to navigate. The layout is not clear and not organized, and 
  it is very difficult to find information on the various programs and resources offered by the school. In this case our team changed this website into a better
  website and our website appears to be structured and easy to navigate as well as the layout is very clear and organized and also our website help us to find 
  information on the various programs and resources offered by the school. So, our team learned this project i.e. Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a crucial 
  area of study in the field of computer science and engineering, as it deals with the design and development of computer systems that are easy to use and understand 
  for human users. The ultimate goal of HCI is to create systems that are intuitive, efficient, and satisfying for users, and that can improve the quality of their 
  interactions with technology. Overall, HCI is an interdisciplinary field that draws on concepts and methods from computer science, psychology, sociology, and other 
  fields to create effective and user-centered systems.</p>
